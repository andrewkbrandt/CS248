}Complete the following problems. These problems are related to Chapters 12 in the Book of Proof. Found at: \\ https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/Main.pdf \\ \\

{\bf Problem 1:} For each of the following functions, determine whether the function is injective, surjective, bijective or none. Also, order the functions in a manner such that if a function $f(x)$ is to the left of $g(x)$ in the ordering, then $f(x)$ is $O(g(x)).$ You do not need to prove any of your conclusions. Assume the domain and co-domain of each function is $\R$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a(x) = 2x$
    
    Injective, not Surjective and not Bijective

    \item $b(x) = 2^x$
    
    Injective, Surjective and Bijective

    \item $c(x) = \log(x)$
    
    Injective, Surjective amd Bijective

    \item $d(x) = x^x$
    \item $e(x) = \frac{1}{x}$
    \item $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{5}$
    \item $g(x) = \frac{x^4-1}{7x+7}$
    \item $h(x) = 918532$
\end{itemize} 

\textit{For problems 2 through 7, prove each of the statements.} \\ 

{\bf Problem 2:} The function $f:\Z \rightarrow \N$, $f(n)= n^2$ is not surjective and not injective.\\

{\bf Problem 3:} The function $f:\N \rightarrow \Z$, $f(n)= 3n-17$ is injective.\\

{\bf Problem 4:} The function $f:\R \rightarrow \Z$, $f(x)= \lfloor x \rfloor$ is surjective. \textit{Note that the floor function, denoted $\lfloor x \rfloor$, just rounds down. \\}

{\bf Problem 5:} The function $f:\Z \rightarrow \Z$, $f(n)=-n + 4$, is a bijection. \textit{Hint: first find its inverse.} \\

{\bf Problem 6:} $\frac{x^3+17}{4x+5}$ is $O(3x^2)$. \\

{\bf Problem 7:} $n \log(n)$ is not $O(100 n)$. Assume log base 10.\\
