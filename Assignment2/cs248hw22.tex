}Complete the following problems. These problems are related to Chapters 12 in the Book of Proof. Found at: \\ https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/Main.pdf \\ \\

{\bf Problem 1:} For each of the following functions, determine whether the function is injective, surjective, bijective or none. Also, order the functions in a manner such that if a function $f(x)$ is to the left of $g(x)$ in the ordering, then $f(x)$ is $O(g(x)).$ You do not need to prove any of your conclusions. Assume the domain and co-domain of each function is $\R$.\\

We say $f(x)$ is $\mathcal{O}(g(x))$ when f(x) is less than or
equal to g(x) to within some constant multiple c

\textit{For problems 2 through 7, prove each of the statements.} \\ 

{\bf Problem 2:} The function $f:\Z \rightarrow \N$, $f(n)= n^2$ is not surjective and not injective.\\

\begin{proof}

    Assume $a=b$, so $(f(a)=a^2)=(f(b)=b^2)$

    we can say that $a^2$ is equal to $b^2$

    now lets set $a=-1$ and $b=1$

    they both equal 1 yet are different values

    therefore the function is not injective.

    Now lets assume that $n=0$

    it follows that $f(0)=0^2$ which is 0.

    zero is not in $\N$

    therefore, the function is not subjective.

\end{proof}

{\bf Problem 3:} The function $f:\N \rightarrow \Z$, $f(n)= 3n-17$ is injective.\\

\begin{proof}

    Assume $f(a)=f(b)$ for some $a,b\in\Z$

    It follows that $3a-17=3b-17$

    we can simplify to $3a=3b$ and then to $a=b$

    Therefore the function is injective.

\end{proof}

{\bf Problem 4:} The function $f:\R \rightarrow \Z$, $f(x)= \lfloor x \rfloor$ is surjective. \textit{Note that the floor function, denoted $\lfloor x \rfloor$, just rounds down. \\}

\begin{proof}

    Let C and k be arbitrary constants.

    

\end{proof}

{\bf Problem 5:} The function $f:\Z \rightarrow \Z$, $f(n)=-n + 4$, is a bijection. \textit{Hint: first find its inverse.} \\

\begin{proof}

    Lets start by finding the inverse of this $f$

    so $y=-x+4$, then switch x and y to get $x=-y+4$

    now rewrite with y on it's own side. $y=4-x$.

    so $f^{-1}(x)=4-x$ and $f(x)=-n+4$

    now look at $f(f{-1}(x))$ which is $-(4-x)+4$. This is equal to $x$

    They are inverses because this is equal to $x$.

    Therefore $f$ is bijective.

\end{proof}

{\bf Problem 6:} $\frac{x^3+17}{4x+5}$ is $O(3x^2)$. \\

\begin{proof}

    We say that $f(x)$ is $O(g(x))$ if there exists constants C and k such that $|f(x)\le C(g(x))$ for all $x>k$

    let $c=1$ and $k=2$, assume $x>k$.

    Then $|\frac{x^3+17}{4x+5}|=\frac{x^3+17}{4x+5}$ because the function will be positive for any $x>2$

    likewise, $|\frac{x^3+17}{4x+5}|>x^3+17$ because removing the $4x+5$ makes it a bigger function.

    also, removing the $+17$ makes it a bigger function.

    If we multiple the $x^3$ by 3, it is a larger function. Then we have $3x^3$

    This can be written as $3|x^3|$. Therefore $f(x)$ is $O(g(x))$

\end{proof}

{\bf Problem 7:} $n \log(n)$ is not $O(100 n)$. Assume log base 10.\\

\begin{proof}

    

\end{proof}
